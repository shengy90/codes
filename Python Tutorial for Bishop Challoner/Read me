Brief notes on the task:

Write a python program that gives a series of arithmetic test to students, then store their test results.

Cannot use (as students have yet to learn the following concepts):

1) use arrays as the primary data structure (and maybe introduce nested array to more capable students)
2) object-oriented programming
3) dictionary/ hash tables
4) functions
